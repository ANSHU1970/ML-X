# Setup ML-X in Your Setup !

- `ML-x` is a library for basic machine learning models with data visualization. For more details refer [README.md](/README.md).

- For Model Development, we primarily use `Google Colab`. Don't worry, it is similar to `Jupyter Notebook`.

- Each model is `well-documented`, making it easy for everyone to understand and use. 

- We improve model working by incorporating web interfaces, developed with `HTML` and `Python`.

- Our models aren't online yet. Your contributions will involve running and visualizing in `localhost:8000`.

- Follow the steps below to setup ML-X in your local system.

## Clone Repo or Download Files

To begin, your first step is to clone the GitHub repository at [OpenCodeEra/ML-X]() or alternatively, you have the option to download the files.
