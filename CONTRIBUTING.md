# Setup ML-X in Your Environment !

Follow the steps below to setup ML-X in your local system.

## Fork the Repo

Before begin, your first step is to fork the Github Repository [OpenCodeEra/ML-X](https://github.com/OpenCodeEra/ML-X).

## Clone Repo or Download Files

Now you have to clone the Forked GitHub repository ie. `<Your-Github-Username>/ML-X` or alternatively, you have the option to download the files.

If you don't know how to clone or where to download the code the watch this video.

- [How to Clone a GitHub Repo](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CKcqniGu3tA)
- [Blog on the same topic, official GitHub Docs](https://docs.github.com/en/repositories/creating-and-managing-repositories/cloning-a-repository)

Or you can run this code in your PC/Laptop terminal

```

```

Great üëè, you have your project ready in your system. Let's explore contribution.

## Ways to Contribute. 

Here, We welcome your ideas and innovation. You can contribute by either updating pre-existing notebooks/models or starting a new model.

> We use the Google Colab environment for model development, and also suggest it to you. However, you have the freedom to use others as well.

### 1. Update a existing notebook 

- You can select from different ideas and improvements for existing notebooks. For example, you can use a different algorithm or dataset with the same model.

- Your contributions are flexible, so you can enhance existing content in various ways.

### 2. Add a new notebook

- You also can add your basic or advanced ml models and notebooks, to make ML-X one-stop hub for everyone.

## Things to Remember While Contributing

- Before you start working, kindly add your model idea in the [Issues](https://github.com/OpenCodeEra/ML-X/issues) section, and we'll be happy to assign it to you. We've also provided an issue template format to make it easy for you to share your model ideas.
  
- When writing a notebook for your model, it's important to include notes in every section. You can refer to [HandWritten Digit Recognition/notebook.ipnyb](https://github.com/OpenCodeEra/ML-X/blob/main/Handwritten%20Digit%20Recognition/notebook.ipynb) for reference.
  
- _**To commit your notebook to the repository, follow these steps :-**_

  - After you've finished your coding, go to the top left section in Colab, click on `File`, and select `Save a copy in Github`.

  </div>
  <br>
  
  - A window will appear. Scroll down and search for your forked ML-X repo in `Repository` ie. `<Your-Github-Username>/ML-X`, then add your file path in this format: `<Model Folder Name>/notebook.ipnyb`.
  - also add an appropriate commit message as per your choice. Don't uncheck `include a link to Colaboratory`.
